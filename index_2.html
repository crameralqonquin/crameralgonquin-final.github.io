          	<p>Playing with your pet rabbit is a fun and important way to bond and provide mental stimulation for your furry friend.</p>
            <p>Make sure the play area is safe and free of hazards, such as electrical cords, toxic plants, or precarious furniture. Supervise your rabbit during playtime to prevent them from getting into mischief.</p>
            <p>Rabbits love toys and will enjoy playing with items such as cardboard boxes, paper towel tubes, chew toys, and stacking cups. Avoid using toys that your rabbit could swallow.</p>
            <p>Treats can be used to motivate and reward your rabbit during playtime. Offer healthy treats, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, in small amounts. Do not overfeed your rabbit, as this can lead to health problems.</p>
            <p>Hide treats or toys around the play area and let your rabbit find them. This will provide mental stimulation and encourage your rabbit to explore their surroundings.</p>
            <p>Show affection to your rabbit. Spend some time petting your rabbit during playtime to strengthen the bond between you and your furry friend.</p>
            <p>Remember, however, that rabbits are delicate animals and can easily become injured during playtime. Use caution when playing with your rabbit and avoid picking them up or holding them too tightly. If your rabbit shows signs of stress or discomfort, stop playtime immediately.</p>
