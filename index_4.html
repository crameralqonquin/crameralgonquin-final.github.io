            <p>Proper nutrition is crucial for the health and well-being of pet rabbits.</p>
            <p>When caring for a rabbit, provide unlimited hay. Timothy hay should make up the majority of a rabbit's diet, and it should be available at all times. Other types of hay, such as orchard grass, meadow hay, and oat hay, can be offered as well. Hay is essential for rabbits because it provides fiber to aid digestion and helps to wear down their constantly growing teeth.</p>
            <p>Always offer fresh vegetables. Feed your rabbit romaine lettuce no less than three times a day. Other leafy greens -- such as kale, arugula, spinach, or cilantro -- can also be given. Avoid giving your rabbit starchy vegetables like potatoes, corn, or squash that might upset their stomachs or lead to GI stasis.</p>
            <p>Remember to limit  pellets. While tasty, pellets should be given in small quantities. Look for pellets that are high in fiber and low in protein and fat. A good guideline is to offer no more than a quarter cup of pellets per day for every 5 pounds of body weight.</p>
            <p>Give treats in moderation. If a rabbit eats too many treats, they can suffer from digestive problems. Certain fruits -- such as apple, blueberry, or banana -- may be given in small quantities for a tasty delight.</p>
            <p>Regularly monitor your rabbit's weight to ensure that they are maintaining a healthy weight. If your rabbit is overweight or underweight, adjust their diet accordingly and consult with a veterinarian.</p>
