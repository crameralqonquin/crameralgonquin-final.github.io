            <p>Proper housing is crucial for the health and well-being of pet rabbits.</p>
            <p>Remember to provide adequate space. Rabbits need enough space to move around and stretch their legs. The shelter should be large enough for your rabbit to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably. If your rabbit lives outdoors, provide a secure run or play area for exercise.</p>
            <p>Keep the shelter clean. To maintain your rabbit's hygiene, remember to clean the shelter that prevents the buildup of waste. Replace soiled bedding or litter every three to five days, and deep clean the shelter weekly.</p>
            <p>Offer hiding places. Rabbits need places to hide and feel secure. Give hiding places such as cardboard boxes, huts, or igloos for your rabbit to retreat to if they need.</p>
            <p>Provide comfortable bedding. Use soft hay, straw, newspaper, or a towel so your rabbit has a soft place to rest on throughout the day.</p>
            <p>Protect from predators. If your rabbit lives outdoors, make sure the shelter is secure and provides protection from predators. Use a sturdy wire mesh to prevent entry from predators such as foxes, raccoons, or birds of prey. Provide a secure latch on the door to prevent them from escaping.</p>
