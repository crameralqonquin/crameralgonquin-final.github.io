            <p>Grooming is essential to maintain the health of your pet rabbit.</p>
            <p>Remember to brush your rabbit's fur. Rabbits need their fur brushed to prevent matting. Use a soft-bristled brush or a comb to gently brush your rabbit's fur in the direction of growth. Be gentle and avoid pulling on the fur, as rabbits have delicate skin.</p>
            <p>Trim your rabbit's nails: Overgrown nails can cause discomfort and even injury to your rabbit. Use a pair of nail clippers specifically designed for small animals to trim your rabbit's nails. Avoid cutting the up to the pink part of the nail so you do not hit a nerve.</p>
            <p>Check your rabbit's teeth. Rabbits have constantly growing teeth and need to chew to keep them from becoming overgrown. Check your rabbit's teeth regularly for signs of overgrowth, such as difficulty eating or drooling. If you notice any problems, consult with a veterinarian.</p>
            <p>Check your rabbit's ears regularly for signs of infection or irritation. Use a soft cloth to gently wipe the outer part of the ear. Do not insert anything into the ear canal, as this can cause injury.</p>
